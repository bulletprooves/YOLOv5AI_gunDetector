### Gun Detector: Real-time Gun(Firearm) Detection Using YOLOv5

Artificial intelligence-based object detection technology has recently become an important research topic in public safety technology.

This project focuses on implementing Gun Detector, which uses the YOLOv5 model to detect guns in real-time within images.

Gun detection is a very important technology for quick response and accident prevention in dangerous situations such as public places, schools, and airports.

#### Project Description

Gun Detector performs the following key functions:

Gun Detection: Use the YOLOv5 model to detect guns in video in real time.

##### Here are some future features based on ideas.

Notifications and Response: You can link the alert system or take additional follow-up actions based on the detection results.

Scalability: Designed to be scalable to other hazardous objects or situational awareness systems.
